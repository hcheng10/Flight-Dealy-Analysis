<p>
  The aim of this project is to use the data set provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) 
  Bureau of Transportation Statistics to analyze factors to predict the number of Total flight and punctuality 
  rate for each day. I want to use the LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) to help me get the result. The ultimate goal 
  of the project is help people travel more efficiently and know the relationship between flight and weather.
